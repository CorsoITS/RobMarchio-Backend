## What the hell is this repo: 
Slow, very buggy, minimalist and barely working CRUD Framework for a mock VAX-HUB.

```js
//Random Code Here, because it's a much more cooler readme with code snippets inside. 
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello casual observer! This is a cool readme!')
})
//Well... maybe not that much cooler. 

```


## Why are you here:
Seriously... why are you here? 

If you are a colleague, a friendly advice: you won't find anything good here, close this tab now. 

If you are Prof. D'Ottavi / Prof Marconi: maybe you were searching for [Carlos's](https://github.com/CorsoITS/Galvis-backend) / [Enrico's](https://github.com/CorsoITS/Enrico-backend) / [Leandro's](https://github.com/CorsoITS/leandro-backend) / [Lorenza's](https://github.com/CorsoITS/lorenza-backend) / [Ousema's](https://github.com/CorsoITS/backend-Ousema) / [Sonia's](https://github.com/CorsoITS/sonia-backend) repo??? 

[seriously: I'm sorry for what you are about to see... you did great, the concepts were very clear, we learned a lot... it's the practice that it's hard! But with time... maybe...I'll get there... or I'll become a junior front-end dev. Using only WYSIWYG page-builders. It's fine. It's the thought that counts.]


<h5> Lastly, if you are a casual websurfer and you are asking yourself "what the hell am I reading"... are you sure you are in the right place? Is this the kind of -HUB you were searching for? Because something tells me that you were searching for another kind of -HUB... an -HUB that starts with P maybe? </h5>
